# Research Agent Creation Summary

**Session ID**: 999d7998-6e51-4917-a7a4-fab0bae28e24  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Task**: Create research-agent for SPARC Phase 0 (Research & Discovery)

## Task Completion Status: âœ… COMPLETED

## Agent Created
- **Name**: research-agent
- **Location**: agents/sparc/research-agent.ts
- **Model**: sonnet
- **Purpose**: Execute parallel web research for project domain, technology stack, competitive landscape, and implementation patterns

## Configuration Details

### Allowed Tools
- `WebFetch` - For web research (WebSearch was forbidden)
- `Read` - To review existing documentation
- `Write` - For creating research reports
- `mcp__levys-awesome-mcp__docs_write` - For documentation
- `mcp__levys-awesome-mcp__put_summary` - For session summaries

### Key Responsibilities
1. Domain research for project area
2. Technology stack analysis and recommendations
3. Competitive landscape and existing solutions analysis
4. Implementation patterns and best practices
5. Synthesize findings into actionable technical decisions
6. Document security and performance considerations

### Research Depth Levels
- **Basic**: Quick technology overview and stack decisions (3-5 sources)
- **Standard**: Include competitive analysis and architectural patterns (5-10 sources)
- **Comprehensive**: Add academic papers and detailed technical analysis (10+ sources)

### Output Format
Structured markdown research report including:
- Executive Summary
- Domain Analysis
- Technology Stack Recommendations (Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure)
- Competitive Analysis
- Implementation Patterns
- Risk Assessment
- Next Steps

## Tool Restriction Compliance
Successfully worked within the tool restrictions by:
- Using `WebFetch` instead of the forbidden `WebSearch` tool
- Avoiding all 39 forbidden tools listed in the restrictions
- Configuring agent with only allowed tools

## Files Created
- `agents/sparc/research-agent.ts` - The TypeScript agent implementation

## Next Steps
The research-agent is now ready to:
1. Be invoked by orchestrator agents for research tasks
2. Execute SPARC Phase 0 research activities
3. Generate comprehensive research reports for project planning
4. Support technology decision-making with data-driven insights
