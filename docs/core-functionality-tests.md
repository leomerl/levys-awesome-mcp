# Core Functionality Tests

This document provides comprehensive tests for all core functionalities of the levys-awesome-mcp system.

## Test Overview

Based on the core functionalities identified:
1. Agent Detection (AgentLoader can detect all agents in agents/ dir)
2. Session management (can resume by session id and memory is retained after resume)
3. Streaming utility (all conversation output is saved to a .log file. if agent was resumed, both invocations are shown)
4. Plan and progress (task completion is tracked using plan and progress files)
5. Agent invocation (agents are orchestrated via invoke agent) through cli and mcp tool
6. Summary enforcement (after each invocation the invoke agent enforces summary creation via resume invocation)
7. User defined backend and frontend directories
8. Dynamic strict write permissions (agent can only write to specific folders)

## Test 1: Agent Detection

### Objective
Verify that AgentLoader can detect all agents in the agents/ directory.

### Test Steps
```bash
# List all agent files
ls agents/*.ts

# Test agent discovery via MCP
# Should detect all agents including static-test-absence-detector
```

### Expected Results
- All .ts agent files in agents/ directory should be detected
- Agent names should match filenames
- Each agent should have valid configuration

## Test 2: Session Management

### Objective
Test session creation, persistence, and resumption capabilities.

### Test Steps
```bash
# Create a new session
# Invoke an agent with session tracking
# Resume the session by ID
# Verify memory retention
```

### Expected Results
- Sessions should be created with unique IDs
- Session state should persist between invocations
- Memory should be retained after resume
- Session logs should show complete conversation history

## Test 3: Streaming Utility

### Objective
Verify that all conversation output is saved to .log files with proper streaming.

### Test Steps
```bash
# Invoke an agent and check for .log file creation
# Resume a session and verify both invocations are logged
# Check streaming output during execution
```

### Expected Results
- .log files should be created for each session
- Both original and resumed invocations should be visible
- Streaming output should be captured in real-time
- Log files should contain complete conversation history

## Test 4: Plan and Progress Tracking

### Objective
Test task completion tracking using plan and progress files.

### Test Steps
```bash
# Create a plan with multiple tasks
# Execute tasks and verify progress updates
# Check plan_and_progress/ directory structure
```

### Expected Results
- Plan files should be created in plan_and_progress/
- Progress should be tracked for each task
- Task states should update correctly (pending → in_progress → completed)
- Git commit hashes should organize plan/progress files

## Test 5: Agent Invocation

### Objective
Test agent orchestration via invoke agent through CLI and MCP tools.

### Test Steps
```bash
# Test CLI invocation
npx tsx agents/[agent-name].ts "test prompt"

# Test MCP invocation
# Use mcp__levys-awesome-mcp__invoke_agent tool
```

### Expected Results
- Agents should execute successfully via CLI
- MCP invocation should work through tool interface
- Both methods should produce equivalent results
- Error handling should be consistent

## Test 6: Summary Enforcement

### Objective
Verify that summary creation is enforced after each invocation.

### Test Steps
```bash
# Invoke an agent
# Check for summary file creation
# Verify summary format and content
```

### Expected Results
- Summary files should be created automatically
- Summary should contain session metadata
- Summary format should be consistent
- Summary should be accessible via get_summary tool

## Test 7: User Defined Directories

### Objective
Test configuration of user-defined backend and frontend directories.

### Test Steps
```bash
# Check content-writer.json configuration
# Verify directory mappings
# Test directory detection
```

### Expected Results
- Backend/frontend directories should be configurable
- Directory mappings should be respected
- Tools should operate within configured boundaries

## Test 8: Dynamic Write Permissions

### Objective
Test that agents can only write to specific folders based on configuration.

### Test Steps
```bash
# Test frontend_write tool with valid path
# Test backend_write tool with valid path
# Attempt to write outside allowed directories
```

### Expected Results
- Write operations should succeed in allowed directories
- Write operations should fail outside allowed directories
- Error messages should be clear and helpful
- Permissions should be enforced consistently

## Test Execution Framework

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript compiler
- All dependencies installed
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY configured

### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Verify all agents are compiled
ls dist/agents/

# Check MCP server functionality
npm test
```

### Test Data Requirements
- Sample TypeScript files for analysis
- Test configuration files
- Mock session data
- Sample plan and progress files

## Automated Test Scripts

### Quick Smoke Test
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running core functionality smoke tests..."

# Test 1: Agent Detection
echo "Testing agent detection..."
ls agents/*.ts > /tmp/agents.txt
echo "Found $(wc -l < /tmp/agents.txt) agents"

# Test 2: Build verification
echo "Testing build process..."
npm run build

# Test 3: MCP server startup
echo "Testing MCP server..."
timeout 5s npm start || echo "MCP server test completed"

echo "Smoke tests completed"
```

### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running comprehensive functionality tests..."

# Create test session
SESSION_ID="test-$(date +%s)"
echo "Test session: $SESSION_ID"

# Test agent invocation
echo "Testing static-test-absence-detector..."
npx tsx agents/static-test-absence-detector.ts "Test prompt for core functionality validation"

# Verify logging
if [ -f "reports/$SESSION_ID/session.log" ]; then
    echo "✓ Session logging works"
else
    echo "✗ Session logging failed"
fi

# Test write permissions
echo "Testing write permissions..."
# These tests would need proper error handling

echo "Comprehensive tests completed"
```

### Error Scenarios Tested
- Invalid agent names
- Missing API keys
- Permission violations
- Network failures
- Malformed configurations

## Continuous Testing

### GitHub Actions Integration
The test suite should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all core functionalities remain working after changes.

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Agent discovery works
- [ ] Sessions can be created and resumed
- [ ] Logs are generated correctly
- [ ] Plans and progress are tracked
- [ ] Agents can be invoked via CLI and MCP
- [ ] Summaries are enforced
- [ ] Directory restrictions work
- [ ] Write permissions are enforced

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Agent not found**: Check agents/ directory and file permissions
2. **Session resume fails**: Verify session ID format and file existence
3. **Logging not working**: Check write permissions for reports/ directory
4. **MCP tools fail**: Verify server is running and authentication is configured
5. **Write permission errors**: Check content-writer.json configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check agent status
npm run list-agents

# Verify configuration
cat content-writer.json

# Check session files
ls -la reports/

# Test MCP connectivity
npm run test-mcp
```

This comprehensive test documentation ensures all core functionalities are properly validated and provides a framework for ongoing testing and quality assurance.
